# 05a-Exercises-pygame-sprites

Four programs experimenting with animation as well as diving into the world of sprites. The first two
programs deal with animation of basic shaps (rectangles) and the the last two work with sprites within
pygame. The final exercise specifically works with sprite sheets, I had some idea of where to begin, but
wasn't sure how to finish. Nonetheless everything else should be completed according to the guildlines and
assignment requirements.
